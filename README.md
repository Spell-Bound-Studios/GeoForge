# GeoForge

GeoForge is our solution for a dynamic 3-Dimensional world. Destructible Re-Forge-Able Terrain, Caves and Tunnels, Large and Complex Landscapes. Almost anything is possible with this technology based on the "Marching Cubes" algorithm.

All systems are free, but some convenient additional assets may be provided in a forthcoming package at modest cost.
